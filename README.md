# Mario Kart DS Track Replacer

## For those wanting to replace tracks

This tool's goal is to offer an easy way for modders and non modders to import track into the game, as it can be annoying to use EFE and/or MKTB. To be honest most of the track on the wiki aren't exported as CARC so in the end it may only have little uses for a small amount of tracks, but I like what I did.

## For people wanting to modify it

GOOD LUCK !! This code is full of bad decision, badly written or named shit and like around 5 or more copied functions. Torture yourself with win32 !
